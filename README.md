This is a web crawler/scraper which is meant to gather all the news from all of your favorite sources, Clip just the headlines and summaries and dates, then present them to you in news-ticker fashion. News-ticker, as in the text rolls steadily across the screen. 
As of 09/21/2020, the program is only able to crawl RSS feeds. Eventually it will be updated to include the following functions;
  1.Twitter feed parsing
  2.HTTP page parsing
  3.GUI Menu for archive & source management
